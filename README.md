# INTERACT Health Survey Descriptive Statistics

This is repo for the descriptive statistics and comparisions between survey waves for the INTERACT study. The repo is organized into folders for each wave and city. We also have folders for comparisons between waves for each city. If you don't want to go through a bunch of folders here are links to the specific markdown files.
